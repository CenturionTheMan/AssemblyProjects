# AssemblyProjects

The repository contains several university projects that involve Assembly programming using the AT&T syntax.

## Table of contents

### Arithmetic Operations
Subproject focuses on implementing basic arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large numbers.

### FPU 
This assembly code demonstrates how to use the Floating-Point Unit (FPU) in assembly language.

### SIMD vs SISD 
This code performs tests to compare the performance of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data) operations. It measures the execution time of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on a set of random numbers.
